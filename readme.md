## ✅ Features Implemented

- ☀ **Sun** at the center of the scene
- 🪐 All **8 planets** (Mercury to Neptune) orbiting in real-time
- 🔁 Each planet has **individual speed and distance**
- 🎛️ **Speed control panel** using sliders (real-time effect)
- 📐 Toggle between **2D and 3D view** modes
- 💡 Realistic **lighting** and **camera perspective**
- ✨ **Background stars** added for visual depth
- 🎞️ Smooth **animations** built using JavaScript & Three.js only
- 📱 **Mobile-responsive** layout
